# List on massives
    It is project for Ilab (Intel course for DREC MIPT). Doubly linked list realized on massives. Instead of Nodes with data, pointer on next and previous Nodes we have three massives: massive of data, massive of next Nodes, massive of previous Nodes. Node is index in massive, on this index elment of data equal data of this Node, element of next equal index of next Node, element of previous equal index of previous Node.
